This project is based on the dataset provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The dataset contains diagnostic measurements of female patients aged 21 years or older. The objective of this project is to analyze the data to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic factors.

<h1>Dataset</h1>
The dataset includes the following diagnostic features:

  1. Pregnancies: Number of times the patient has been pregnant.
  2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
  3. Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
  4. Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
  5. Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
  6. BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
  7. Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
  8. Age: Age of the patient (years).
  9. Outcome: 0 or 1 (Class variable: 0 indicates non-diabetic, 1 indicates diabetic).
    
<h1>Objective</h1>
The primary goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on the diagnostic measurements in the dataset.
